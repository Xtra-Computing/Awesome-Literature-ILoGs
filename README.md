# Awesome Literature for Imbalanced Learning on Graphs (ILoGs)
This repository showcases a curated collection of research literature on imbalanced learning on graphs. We've categorized this literature according to the taxonomies of problems and techniques detailed in our survey paper, titled [A Survey of Imbalanced Learning on Graphs: Problems, Techniques, and Future Directions](xxx.xxx.xxx). In this repository, we primarily arrange the literature based on our problem taxonomy for clarity. For a deeper understanding of this rapidly evolving and challenging field, we encourage readers to consult our survey.

For our taxonomy of Problems, we classify the literature based on class imbalance and structure imbalance, both stemming from imbalanced input. We further distill this into more specific categories: node-, edge-, and graph-level imbalance, offering a comprehensive understanding of graph imbalance.
